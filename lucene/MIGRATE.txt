# Apache Lucene Migration Guide

## Separation of IndexDocument and StoredDocument (LUCENE-3312)

The API of oal.document was restructured to differentiate between stored 
documents and indexed documents. IndexReader.document(int) now returns 
StoredDocument instead of Document. In most cases a simple replacement
of the return type is enough to upgrade.

## FunctionValues.exist() Behavior Changes due to ValueSource bug fixes (LUCENE-5961)

Bugs fixed in several ValueSource functions may result in different behavior in 
situations where some documents do not have values for fields wrapped in other 
ValueSources.  Users who want to preserve the previous behavior may need to wrap 
their ValueSources in a "DefFunction" along with a ConstValueSource of "0.0".

## Removal of FilteredQuery (LUCENE-6583)

FilteredQuery has been removed. Instead, you can construct a BooleanQuery with
one MUST clause for the query, and one FILTER clause for the filter.

## PhraseQuery and BooleanQuery made immutable (LUCENE-6531 LUCENE-6570)

PhraseQuery and BooleanQuery are now immutable and have a builder API to help
construct them. For instance a BooleanQuery that used to be constructed like
this:

  BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
  bq.add(q1, Occur.SHOULD);
  bq.add(q2, Occur.SHOULD);
  bq.add(q3, Occur.MUST);
  bq.setMinimumNumberShouldMatch(1);

can now be constructed this way using its builder:

  BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery.Builder()
      .add(q1, Occur.SHOULD)
      .add(q2, Occur.SHOULD)
      .add(q3, Occur.SHOULD)
      .setMinimumNumberShouldMatch(1)
      .build();

## AttributeImpl now requires that reflectWith() is implemented (LUCENE-6651)

AttributeImpl removed the default, reflection-based implementation of
reflectWith(AttributeReflector). The method was made abstract. If you have
implemented your own attribute, make sure to add the required method sigature.
See the Javadocs for an example.
